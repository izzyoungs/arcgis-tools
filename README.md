# Toolbox Summary
This repository holds a collection of custom ArcGIS Geoprocessing scripts for ArcGIS Pro 3.2. This repository also contains an atbx to assist in automated running of repeated tasks. The tools are described below:
* *Guess CRS* - This geoprocessing tool was created with R with the help of [Kyle Walker](https://walker-data.com/)'s [crssuggest](https://github.com/walkerke/crsuggest) library. The tool takes a custom bounding box and returns a list of possible projections.
* *Create Feature Datasets* - This geoprocessing tool takes a list of feature dataset names, a workspace, and a projection, and writes all of the feature datasets to the workspace with the selected projection settings.
